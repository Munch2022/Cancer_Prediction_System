# Description:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenge against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous). This holds the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Cancer sample cells Dataset. 

# Project is dvivided into 2 segments- 
  * Machine LEarning Segment
  * Deployment Segment 
  
Mahine Learning Segment: The dataset does'nt have any missing values hence it was pure set to move ahead with model. SVM classier algorithm is used to classify the begnin and malignant cancer cells. Have tried two different kernels where 'rbf' has prpved to be a good kernel with less loss function. 
Prediction is done on test data as well as the new data and the ouput seems to be accurate. 

Deployment Segmment: Using a virtual environment. The model is pickled, saved and loaded to another file. Streamlit has been used for the deployment. The model is hosted in a local server 

# Predictive model: Overview

‚Ä¢	Created a tool that predicts if the cells are cancerous or non-cancerous 
‚Ä¢	Refered to a dataset in Kaggel
‚Ä¢	Exploration and computations were done on the dataset to know about it
‚Ä¢	Optimized using SVM classifier model
